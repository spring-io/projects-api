= projects-api

Spring projects are listed and documented on the spring.io website. 
We can find there information about releases, samples, support and more.
These projects are managed in GitHub.

This project provides a RESTful web layer on top of GitHub's API for fetching and updating Spring Project Metadata.
It uses hypermedia to describe the relationships between resources and to allow navigation between them.
